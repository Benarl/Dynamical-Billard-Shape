For now you can test the square solution, by changing the initial angle, the initial position, the length and see what is the resulting shape.

## Installation

You need to clone the respository and install python 3.8 with pip, and pipenv.

Then you will need to install all the packages, in command line with :

```pipenv install```

Finally, to test the square solution, run :

``python app_square.py``
